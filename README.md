# zx_spectrum_composite_key_gen
zx Spectrum composite key generator PCB. 

This PCB goes in parallel with the normal keyboard tails and allows composite keys to be wired to their own seperate keys with a seperate header for the cursor keys. 

Bugs: 
Left diodes are backwards to the rest. Silk screen is correct. Be careful assembling

Corrected bugs:
U4 is the wrong way around
Most of the symbol shift chars are not linked to to symbol shift. Whoops.
